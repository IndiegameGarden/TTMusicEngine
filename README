NOTE: included from 2013 onwards as part of TTengine.

TTMusicEngine is a C# music engine, which uses an audio engine 
"under the hood". It supports multi-track 
interactive (real-time) music/audio mixing and effects. Currently it
links to the FMOD audio engine but binding to IrrKlang is also
possible. In the future it might support an easy declarative scripting 
language for defining music and effects, but currently only scripting
in C# is supported. Warning: the API is not particularly friendly nor
documented at this point in time!
