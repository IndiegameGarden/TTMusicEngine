
TTMusicEngine is not a typical audio engine but a music engine, which
uses an audio engine "under the hood". It supports multi-track 
interactive music generation and effects for C# XNA 4.0. Currently it
links to the FMOD audio engine but future binding to IrrKlang is also
planned. In the future it might support an easy declarative scripting 
language for defining music and effects, but currently only scripting
in C# is supported. Warning: the API is not particularly friendly nor
documented at this point in time!

In the future, more information might be posted on http://www.trancetrance.com/
